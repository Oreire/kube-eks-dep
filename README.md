PUsh Image to AWS ECR
Perfect, Ayomide. Since your local Docker image is named `ghs-nginx-app46` and your AWS account ID is `160002177953`, here’s exactly what you need to do to push it to Amazon ECR:

---

### 🧭 Step-by-Step: Push `ghs-nginx-app46` to ECR

#### 1. **Authenticate Docker to ECR**
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 160002177953.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

---

#### 2. **Create the ECR Repository (if not already created)**
```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ghs-nginx-app46 --region eu-west-2
```

---

#### 3. **Tag Your Local Image**
```bash
docker tag ghs-nginx-app46:latest 160002177953.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ghs-nginx-app46:latest
```

---

#### 4. **Push the Image to ECR**
```bash
docker push 160002177953.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ghs-nginx-app46:latest
```

---

Once that’s done, your image will be available in ECR and ready to be referenced in your Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.

Want me to help you patch your `deployment.yaml` to use this image, or automate this entire flow in GitHub Actions? You're just a few keystrokes away from full GitOps glory.


aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 160002177953.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com


docker tag ghs-nginx-app46 160002177953.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ghs-nginx-app46
docker push 160002177953.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ghs-nginx-app46















WORK DONE
Fantastic. Let’s recap and set you up for success going forward:

---

### ✅ Final Infrastructure Fixes You’ve Completed
- **IAM Permissions**: You incrementally added all required actions (IAM, EKS, KMS, CloudWatch) to your user’s policy.
- **CloudWatch Log Group Conflict**: You deleted the pre-existing log group that was blocking Terraform.
- **Manual Lifecycle Management**: You now have full control over your CloudWatch logs via a dedicated Terraform resource.
- **Terraform Apply Progress**: You're nearly at a clean run—all major blockers have been resolved.

---

### 🔧 What You Might Do Next

1. **Run `terraform apply` again**  
   With the log group deleted and IAM policy updated, this apply should finally spin up your EKS cluster and supporting infra.

2. **Stabilize Long-Term with a CI/CD Role**  
   Instead of running Terraform as a user, consider creating a dedicated IAM role with a trust policy for GitHub Actions or automation tools. It'll boost security and consistency.

3. **Scope Down IAM Policy**  
   Now that you’ve mapped what Terraform really needs, we could tighten your policy by:
   - Restricting actions to specific ARNs
   - Using tag conditions
   - Segmenting by service

4. **Add Output Validations**  
   You can add sanity-check outputs (e.g., EKS cluster status, VPC ID, log group retention) to confirm everything provisioned cleanly.

---

Would you like to:
- Generate that IAM execution role?
- Tighten the policy now?
- Or go full GitOps and prep this for a PR into your infra repo?

Wherever you're headed, I’m ready to blueprint it with you.
