WORK DONE
Fantastic. Letâ€™s recap and set you up for success going forward:

---

### âœ… Final Infrastructure Fixes Youâ€™ve Completed
- **IAM Permissions**: You incrementally added all required actions (IAM, EKS, KMS, CloudWatch) to your userâ€™s policy.
- **CloudWatch Log Group Conflict**: You deleted the pre-existing log group that was blocking Terraform.
- **Manual Lifecycle Management**: You now have full control over your CloudWatch logs via a dedicated Terraform resource.
- **Terraform Apply Progress**: You're nearly at a clean runâ€”all major blockers have been resolved.

---

### ðŸ”§ What You Might Do Next

1. **Run `terraform apply` again**  
   With the log group deleted and IAM policy updated, this apply should finally spin up your EKS cluster and supporting infra.

2. **Stabilize Long-Term with a CI/CD Role**  
   Instead of running Terraform as a user, consider creating a dedicated IAM role with a trust policy for GitHub Actions or automation tools. It'll boost security and consistency.

3. **Scope Down IAM Policy**  
   Now that youâ€™ve mapped what Terraform really needs, we could tighten your policy by:
   - Restricting actions to specific ARNs
   - Using tag conditions
   - Segmenting by service

4. **Add Output Validations**  
   You can add sanity-check outputs (e.g., EKS cluster status, VPC ID, log group retention) to confirm everything provisioned cleanly.

---

Would you like to:
- Generate that IAM execution role?
- Tighten the policy now?
- Or go full GitOps and prep this for a PR into your infra repo?

Wherever you're headed, Iâ€™m ready to blueprint it with you.
